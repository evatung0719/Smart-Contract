About the Project
-----------------
ShippingContract is a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate cargo tracking and insurance management on the blockchain. This contract allows buyers to register their shipments, purchase various types of insurance, and update the cargo's status. In case of delays, loss, or damage, the smart contract automates compensation calculations and fund transfers based on predefined conditions.
